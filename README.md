# PyCompile
Lightweight shell-script to compile Python files into C and executables.

This compiler only works on Linux distros, and only with Python 3.8. Please make sure all Python related fils are in /usr/share/python3.8 or this compiler will NOT work. I did not have the time to make it work for *every single version* because that is lengthy and time consuming. If you need, edit the source code to include your own Python folder or even make it work for Windows!

If you want to submit an update to the script to make it compatible with more devices or versions, email me at theenigmaproject@cyberservices.com and I will happily put it in here.

PyCompile is only a shell-script, not a GUI based compiler. Seemed rather unnecessary for something so lightweight.

Both files will only run when invoked by a terminal or shell.

***If you need to compile a file that is in a different directory to this script, please use it's full path otherwise it will fail.***

Enjoy!
